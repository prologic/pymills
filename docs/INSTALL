pymills Installation Guide
==========================
pymills is a collection of works by James Mills containing
general purpose and special purpose libraries and modules
for the Python programming language. Most libraries and
modules are based around a core component of pymills, the
"event" library.

pymills provides a very easy to use and powerful event
library enabling asyncronous and event-driven applications
and system to be developed. Software systems and applications
written with pymills.event are broken up into components
and can be distributed across different nodes.

pymills also contains an ann library which provides the
building blocks to build artificial neural networks in
an asyncronous/event-driven manner closely modelling
biological neural networks.


Requirements
------------
To install pymills, the following software packages must be installed:

 * Python, version >= 2.4.


Installing pymills
------------------
The command:

  $ python ./setup.py install

will byte-compile the python source code and install it in the
site-packages directory of your python installation. The directory examples
will be copied to ``$prefix/share/pymills/``.

Note: you'll need root permissions or equivalent for this step.

To install pymills in a different location, or use other advanced installation
options, run:

  $ python ./setup.py --help


Installing pymills on Windows
--------------------------
If you downloaded the pymills installer (the .exe file), installing is simply a
matter of running the installer.


Using pymills
-------------
Once you have installed pymills, it should be available to import into your
python application or system The statement:

import pymills

will import the pymills package. To import a specific library or module:

from pymills import event

will import the event library.

Please read the documentation on the pymills website or through the python
pydoc command or help() function:

pydoc pymills
