About pymills
=============

pymills is a collection of works by James Mills containing
general purpose and special purpose libraries and modules
for the Python programming language. Most libraries and
modules are based around a core component of pymills, the
"event" library.

pymills provides a very easy to use and powerful event
library enabling asyncronous and event-driven applications
and system to be developed. Software systems and applications
written with pymills.event are broken up into components
and can be distributed across different nodes.

pymills also contains an ann library which provides the
building blocks to build artificial neural networks in
an asyncronous/event-driven manner closely modelling
biological neural networks.

pymills is distributed using the GNU License.

 * For installation instructions, please see the INSTALL. *

You might also want to take a look at the RELEASE and ChangeLog files for more
information.

I hope you enjoy it,
