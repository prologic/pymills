"""Bridge

Brige component to bridge one or more other nodes in a single system.
That is, events in system A bridged to system B are shared. For exampe:

A <-- Bridge --> B

Events that propagate in A, will propagate to B across the Bridge.
Events that propagate in B, will propagate to A across the Bridge.

When the Bridge is created, it will automatically attempt to send a
Helo event to any configured nodes.
